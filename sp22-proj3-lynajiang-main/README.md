# CS61CPU

Look ma, I made a CPU! Here's what I did:

This project was pretty cool and it made us feel like we were real Computer Scientists. It did take a lot of time to do each task, and it was also pretty annoying to debug when we had instructions that were failing. However, we mostly had fun. 

One bug we encountered that was really annoying was with pipelining at the end. We thought that we could use the inputs of the register (such as WriteEnable and AsynchronousRead) with PCSel in order to output a no-op. We kept trying all kinds of configurations, thinking that stopping the instructions for a clock cycle would give us the stall we needed for branch/jump instructions. However, the solution was much simpler than that. We asked on Piazza and Adelson (SHOUTOUT TO ADELSON) said that we just needed to use a MUX! I feel like doing a bit of practice in Logisim in lab on pipelining/using pipeline registers would've been really helpful because we really overthought it. 

One task we learned a lot from was setting up the ROM (and filling out the Google Sheet). This really made us think about what each instruction actually needs to do and how to check instructions (relating back to when we put RISC-V into binary) to see what the instruction even was. 

Something we wished we could've done would be to change the input a bit more than just the instruction. For example, putting values in registers. In the CPU circuit, there was a box for them, but we couldn't change them so we couldn't debug as smoothly. 

We really appreciated the ROM Google Sheet set up. It would've been really annoying to have to figure that all out on our own and that scaffolding definitely saved us a lot of time. It would've been helpful if we were given concrete ImmSel values (like the ones given in Task 7) before Task 7 so that we would be able to take advantage of that similar structure for our own debugging. 

In conclusion, overall, in sum, we enjoyed this project & it felt it was worthwhile, even if it did take a long time. Thank you for coming to our TED Talk! :)
